	<h1>The Importance of HTML and coding</h1>

	<h2>What is coding and why is it important?</h2>
	<p>Coding is writing instructions for a computer to read and process, it tells the computer what to do and how to do it. In this sense coding could be considered the absolute most literal way of comunicating. Code does everything in computers from running the operating system to running a source game. For developers computer programing is a way to organize their thoughts.</p>
	<p>Most of editing code in text is very visual in that you can see where all of the variables you put are, where certain functions are, and where what parts of the code does. For example: in the Processing programming sketchbook there are two main functions used in every sketch, "setup()" and "draw()".</p>
	<pre class="code">
void setup() {
  size(800, 400);
}

void draw() {
  
}</pre>
	<p>In setup you put in all the code to be ran as the sketch starts up, and draw runs the code in it 60 times a second.</p>
	<p>Organizing your code allows it to be broken down into "chunks" which can be worked on by a group of developers. Many good developers organize their information in order to make the coding process alot easier and quicker.</p>
	<h2>Uses of coding</h2>
	<p>Oprotunities for coding are showing up everywhere, personally I think learning and using code applies in similar ways to learning music. Music is everywhere such as in movies, TV shows, games, and on the radio. Coding is much the same. CGI has been used in movies sence the 80s, video games are a huge market entirley depended on coding. Many designers and visual artists use code to create visual artwork or simulations that would have been impossible to make by hand.
	</p>
	<p>Over the past couple of years many popular figures in the tech industry have encouraged countless times for schools to start teaching code in classrooms for students to learn and get a mindset for it. Steve Jobs once said, â€œI think everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer because it teaches you how to think."</p>
	<p>There are more tech related jobs than ever before. In 2015 seven million jobs were opened that required coding skills. Interestingly half of all program openings are in fields outside of technology including Finance, Manufacturing, and Healthcare.</p>
